        The disciplines I teach focus on the field of Musicology, including
        History of Music 1 to 4, Brazilian Music 1, 2, and 3, Introduction to
        Music Research, and supervision of undergraduate and Master&apos;s
        degree capstone projects and theses. Previously, while working as a
        professor of Ethnomusicology at the same institution, I taught
        Introduction to the Anthropology of Music, Music and Oral Traditions in
        Brazil, and Introduction to the World&apos;s Musics. In addition to
        these, I have been offering courses that aim to provide knowledge of
        audio recording and editing, as well as music notation and typesetting.
